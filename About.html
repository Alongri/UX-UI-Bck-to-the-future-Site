      <h1>Back to the future Plot</h1>
    <p>
      In 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill Valley, California, with his
      depressed alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older siblings, who are
      professional and social failures; and his meek father, George, who is
      bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen. After Marty's band is rejected
      from a music audition, he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker,
      that he fears becoming like his parents despite his ambitions. That night,
      Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, Emmett "Doc" Brown, in the
      Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a
      modified DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan
      terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955-the
      day he first conceived his time travel invention-the terrorists arrive
      unexpectedly and gun Doc down. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently
      activating time travel when he reaches 88 miles per hour (142 km/h).
      Arriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium to return. While
      exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father
      and discovers Biff was bullying George even then. George falls into the
      path of an oncoming car while spying on the teenage Lorraine changing
      clothes, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to
      find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty
      tracks down and convinces a younger Doc that he is from the future, but
      Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the
      power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a
      flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the
      town's courthouse. As Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he is
      carrying with him, Doc realizes Marty's actions are altering the future
      and jeopardizing his existence; Lorraine was supposed to tend to George
      instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents
      acquainted fail, and Lorraine's infatuation with Marty deepens. Lorraine
      asks Marty to the school dance, and he plots to feign inappropriate
      advances on her, allowing George to intervene and "rescue" her, but the
      plan goes awry when Biff's gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing
      band's car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives
      expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts
      Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the
      grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but
      the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process, so Marty takes his
      place, performing while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With
      his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty heads to the courthouse to meet
      Doc. Doc discovers a letter from Marty warning him about his future and
      rips it, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty re-calibrates
      the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he left the future. The
      lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks
      down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being
      shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he pieced
      Marty's note back together and wore a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty
      home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning to
      discover his father is now a confident and successful science fiction
      author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff
      is a servile valet in George's employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer,
      Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to
      the future to save their children from terrible fates.
