                In the Darth Vader scene, Marty has a modern hair dryer tucked in his belt, obviously not something they had in 1955. Where did this come from?

              <div class="accordion-body">The hair dryer was in a suitcase that 1985 Doc put into the DeLorean trunk at Twin Pines Mall. There was a scene in which 1955 Doc looks through the contents of that suitcase, picks up the hair dryer and asks "What's this?" "A hair dryer," Marty replies. Doc shakes his head and says, "A hair dryer? Don't they have towels in the future?" However, the scene was cut from the final film (for time).</div>

              <div class="accordion-body">No. Hoverboards do NOT really exist. This is the most asked question we get in letters and phone calls. Yes, Director Robert Zemeckis did give an interview in which he said that hoverboards were real, but his tongue was firmly in cheek. Nevertheless, a lot of people believed it — including some executives at one of the three major television networks! We'll say it again: HOVERBOARDS ARE NOT REAL. But based on our mail, there's a tremendous demand for them, so maybe some enterprising inventor should get to work!</div>

              When Doc and Marty are in 1985-A, Doc says they can't return to the future to stop Biff from stealing the DeLorean, because it would be the wrong future. But if that's true, how did Old Biff manage to get back to the same future that he left? Shouldn't he have come back to a different future?
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="flush-collapseSix" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingSix" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
            <div class="accordion-body">As should be clear from the answer to the previous question, we believe Old Biff DID indeed return to a different future — a "2015-A," which would have transformed around Marty, Doc, Jennifer and Einstein (just as Doc explains how 1985-A would change into 1985 and instantly transform around Jennifer and Einstein). This would happen AFTER Old Biff returned with the DeLorean. For this reason, we made sure that Doc had caught Jennifer and exited the McFly Townhouse before Old Biff returned. Thus, by the time Marty and Doc are carrying Jennifer back to the DeLorean, there COULD be other residents in that townhouse — or perhaps the McFlys still live there. It is just as believable that the physicality of the neighborhood did NOT change as it is to believe that it did — so we didn't change it. We decided not to make anything of this idea because this is one of those difficult time travel concepts that general audiences have a real hard time understanding. (Try explaining this stuff to your mother and you'll see what we mean.) A detailed explanation of it would have slowed down the story, and most of the audience doesn't ever think about it. That's why we made certain things ambiguous and left various things open for interpretation in hopes that the possibility of at least one or two explanations would be better than a "definitive" explanation that you could find holes in. Let's face it, time travel is fantasy, so there's no way to "prove" anything. As filmmakers, we try to create a set of rule for our stories and stick by them, and stay consistent within the little "universe" that we've created.</div>
